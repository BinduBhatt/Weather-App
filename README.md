With this project, I have tried to develop a python program that uses API of 'OpenWeather' website to retrieve  weather information. 
It allows the user to enter city and get the weather information. 
I have used 
- tkinter library for GUI creation. 
- tkinter library to create city dropdowns
- requests library to hit the url and get the information using API.
